# Cara Ebert

I am a development economist working on how gender biases affect women's health and how out-migration interacts with social and economic conditions in rural communities to shape livelihoods. I head the Berlin Office and the Reasearch Group Global Migration at the RWI -- Leibniz Institute for Economic Research. Most of my field work was or is located in India (Bihar) and Senegal. For my PhD dissertation I was awarded the 3rd prize Young Researcher Award of the German Economic Association’s Research Group on Development Economics and the KfW Development Bank. I am a Research Affiliate at the IZA Institute of Labor Economics and a former fellow of the Joachim Herz Foundation. I teach at the Humboldt University of Berlin.
