# Cara Ebert

I am a development economist working on how gender biases affect women's health and how out-migration interacts with social and economic conditions in rural communities to shape livelihoods. Most of my field work was or is located in India (Bihar) and Senegal. 

I head the Berlin Office and the Research Group Global Migration at the RWI -- Leibniz Institute for Economic Research. I am a Research Fellow at the IZA Institute of Labor Economics and a former fellow of the Joachim Herz Foundation. I teach at the Humboldt University of Berlin.
